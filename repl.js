// Here's an example of how to use the Node.js REPL to experiment with code snippets and test out features in real-time:

// Open a terminal window or command prompt.
// Type node and press Enter to launch the Node.js REPL.
// You should see a prompt that looks like this: >.
// Now you can start typing JavaScript code snippets and see their output in real-time.
// Here's an example of a code snippet you can try:

// css
// Copy code
// > const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
// undefined
// > sum(2, 3);
// 5
// In this example, we define a simple function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. We then call the function with two numbers and see the result (which is 5) printed to the console.

// You can also use the Node.js REPL to experiment with other features of the Node.js environment, such as modules, global variables, and asynchronous code.
